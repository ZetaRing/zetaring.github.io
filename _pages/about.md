HiðŸ‘‹ , I am a 2nd-Year CSE PhD student (2024Fall - 2029) at The Ohio State University, advised by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sachinkumar" target="_blank">Sachin Kumar</a>. My research interests focus on the safety of large language models, multimodality, and embodied agents.

I previously completed my M.S. in Computational Biology at the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2024), where I conducted research in computational neuroscience ðŸ§  with a focus on memory and sleep. I obtained my B.Sc. in CSE from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University (2019).

My industry experience includes an internship at Microsoft Research Asia (2018) and a subsequent role at Microsoft STCA (2019), where I primarily worked on semantic segmentation and neural network compression, with a particular focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
